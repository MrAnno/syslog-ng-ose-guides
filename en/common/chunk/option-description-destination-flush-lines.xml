    <para><emphasis role="bold">Description:</emphasis> Specifies how many lines are flushed to a destination at a time. The &abbrev; application waits for this number of lines to accumulate and sends them off in a single batch. Increasing this number increases throughput as more messages are sent in a single batch, but also increases message latency. To limit the latency, adjust the <parameter>flush-timeout()</parameter> option.</para>
    <para>By default, &abbrev; waits for 100 lines. If the source sends a few messages, but less than 100 messages, &abbrev; will not send the messages to the destination until the <parameter>flush-timeout()</parameter> time passes (which is 10 seconds by default). If you stop or reload &abbrev; or in case of network sources, the connection with the client is closed, &abbrev; automatically sends the unsent messages to the destination.</para>
