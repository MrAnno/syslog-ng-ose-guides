        <p>A syslog-ng destination recognizes a message as sent when the message has been sent to the Kafka client, not when the Kafka server confirms its delivery.</p>
        <p>If the Kafka client collects too many unsent messages, it will not accept any more messages from syslog-ng. The syslog-ng application detects this and stops sending messages to the Kafka client. Also, syslog-ng's flow control starts functioning in the direction of the sources (for example, syslog-ng will not read from the sources in that specific logpath).</p>
        <p>You can specify a "high water mark" limit for the Kafka client in the properties-file(). </p>
