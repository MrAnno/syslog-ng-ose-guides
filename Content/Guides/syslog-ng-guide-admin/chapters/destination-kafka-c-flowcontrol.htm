		<h1 name="destination-kafka-c-flowcontrol">Flow control in <MadCap:variable name="General.abbrev"></MadCap:variable> and the Kafka client</h1>
		<p>A syslog-ng destination recognizes a message as sent when the message has been delivered to the kafka client, not when the kafka server reports its delivery.</p>
		<p>If the kafka client collects too many unsent messages, it will not receive any more messages from syslog-ng. The syslog-ng (device?) detects this and stops sending messages to the kafka client. Also, syslog-ng's flow control starts functioning in the direction of the sources (for example, syslog-ng will not read from the sources in that specific logpath).</p>
