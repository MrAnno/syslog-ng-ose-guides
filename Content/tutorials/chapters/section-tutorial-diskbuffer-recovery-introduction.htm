   When you change the configuration of a
   <MadCap:variable name="General.abbrev">
    abbrev
   </MadCap:variable>
   host that uses disk-based buffering (also called dis queue),
   <MadCap:variable name="General.abbrev">
    abbrev
   </MadCap:variable>
   may start new disk buffer files for the destinations that you have changed. In such case,
   <MadCap:variable name="General.abbrev">
    abbrev
   </MadCap:variable>
   abandons the old disk queue files. If there were unsent log messages in the  disk queue files, these messages remain in the disk queue files, and will not be sent to the destinations.

   This document explains the steps required to find, examine, and flush the log messages from such orphaned disk queue files.
